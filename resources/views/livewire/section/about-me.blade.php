                As a full-stack developer, I love to bring ideas to life. With over five years of experience, I focus on delivering high-quality web solutions across both the front-end and back-end. My journey began with backend development, where I specialized in <span class="text-[#8993be]">PHP</span> and <span class="text-[#F8332B]">Laravel</span>, but Iâ€™ve since expanded my skill set to include <span class="text-[#61DBFB]">React</span> and <span class="text-[#3177C7]">TypeScript</span>, allowing me to create engaging user interfaces. Passionate about learning, I continuously seek out new tools and frameworks to keep my skills sharp and deliver impactful results.

                Besides coding, I love singing and playing the guitar. Music has always been a big part of my life, and I enjoy creating covers. I haven't done one in a while, but I'm planning to get back to it soon. I am not so much of a reader, but I love watching movies and TV shows.
